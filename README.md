# NEAT-Axelrod


My attempt at creating NEAT-PYTHON - Axelrod PD link for research purposes only.


USING NEAT on an implemented stimulator to evolve Prisoners dilemma strategies by varying on agentâ€™s intelligence (neuron size)


Using NEAT (NeuroEvoution of Augmenting topologies) (Stanley, 2002) neural network/genetic algorithm, to play the a version of the iterated prisoners dilemma, this experiment we will increase the neuron which act as a proxy for the inputs of memory in our previous opponents moves, we will see if increased memory (Neuron) can indeed promote cooperative behavior.
